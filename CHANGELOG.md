  once.
- Mass-Message sender, can send your message to the users by counting backwards
 from the given id number. It's currently in beta stage and needs some
  performance improvements. (<https://ibb.co/mb7tOA>)
- Under the "supervisors" page, you will some changes on the couple of elements

 attachment in to their response. This feature makes some confusion about who
 added this attachment, so in this update you can see only the related user
 answer attachment icon only. There is no need to show an icon for other user's
 attachments.

 [this](http://i.imgur.com/fRwLKqr.png) text before to switch the reported
 content between question&answer and comments, now its clickable. (Btw.

 extension can also use the extension with just access permission can be given
 by the extension manager. This will not be any security risks for Brainly and
 moderating system at all, because they don't have privilege to make actions.)

 approved by another user while extension user starts to delete or approve the
 content, extension will inform you about this and pass this process without
 being stucked.
